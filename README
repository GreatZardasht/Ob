This obfuscator produces files that will not verify on Java 7, to get past this use the following flag:
-XX:-UseSplitVerifier
when running code that is modified with this obfuscator.
This shall be addressed soon.

- field renaming
- string encryption

Run as:
	java -cp bcel.jar com.speed.ob.Obfuscate files...
